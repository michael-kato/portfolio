<div class="project-section">
  <p>I collaborated with lead engineers to develop a comprehensive performance monitoring solution for Horizon Worlds' rapid weekly release schedule. What began as my solo effort evolved into a dedicated performance team initiative.</p>
  
  <p>The framework enabled us to:</p>
  <ul class="project-list">
    <li>Track dozens of high and low-level code subsystems like physics, script, and rendering</li>
    <li>Run automated benchmarks on a scheduled cadence and to test new code submissions</li>
    <li>Detect issues within hours of code changes and provide profiler artifacts as a downloadable file</li>
    <li>Proactively address performance problems before weekly releases went live</li>

  <p>Horizon Worlds generated massive performance data from multiple sourcesâ€”instrumentation, automation, playtests, and production. To make this information accessible to all team members, I developed interactive dashboards that transformed our performance workflow.</p>
  
  <p>These visualization tools:</p>
  <ul class="project-list">
    <li>Enabled users to drill down in many performance dimensions including world, player count, device type, time of day, etc.</li>
    <li>Automatically detected regressions and emailed alerts to relevant stakeholders</li>
    <li>Enabled data-driven prioritization of optimizations and helped teams demonstrate impact of performance work</li>
    <li>Helped non-technical stakeholders understand and share performance trends</li>

<div class="project-section">
  <p>At Apple, we processed thousands of 3D models from internal teams and external vendors. Quality issues frequently caused pipeline failures, wasting resources during training data generation. I developed validation tools that transformed our asset pipeline.</p>
  
  <p>These QA tools:</p>
  <ul class="project-list">
    <li>Checked for a host of common asset importation errors such as abnormal size, missing textures, improper material settings, etc.</li>
    <li>Generated thumbnail images automatically for use the asset browser</li>

<div class="project-section">
  <p>Apple Vision Pro required massive amounts of diverse visual scenes to train it's visual recognition capability. I architected a procedural generation system that created semi-randomized sets of interior layouts to help generate new data overnight without the need for additional artists.</p>
  
  <p>The system:</p>
  <ul class="project-list">
    <li>Procedurally modified the floorplan of existing interior scenes and dynamically extruded new walls, then deleted assets clipping through the space, and saved incremental files for offline rendering</li>

<div class="project-section">
  <p>For Call of Duty: WWII, creating multiple LODs for thousands of assets consumed significant artist resources with inconsistent results. I integrated and customized a proprietary LOD generation system that saved hundreds, possibly thousands of hours of artist time.</p>
  
  <p>This automated system:</p>
  <ul class="project-list">
    <li>Reduced LOD creation time from hours to minutes per asset, so much so that I was able to effectively add LODs to nearly the entire game</li>
    <li>Enabled more consistent and aggressive LODs compared to what artists typically author manually</li>
    <li>Maintained consistent visual quality across LOD transitions, often better than manually authored</li>
    <li>Helped achieve 60fps across all game modes and console platforms</li>

  "project-edge-cleanup": {
    title: "Edge Cleanup Tool",
    description: `
<div class="project-section">
  <p>During modeling, artists often create additional edges for construction that don't contribute to the final appearance but increase polygon counts, and in our engine there was an issue where tangents would be explicitly imported in a broken state due to data moving between programs, which caused vertex counts to massively inflate. I developed a Maya Python tool that analyzes mesh topology to identify redundant edges.</p>
  
  <p>This optimization tool:</p>
  <ul class="project-list">
    <li>Automatically smoothed normals which resulted in lower vertex counts in engine, while our engineers figured out a more permanent solution</li>
    <li>Uses adjustable thresholds to determine which edges to remove</li>
    <li>Maintains UV mapping and material boundaries during optimization</li>
    <li>Became a standard part of our asset export process</li>

      <p>Assets created for my Unity game "Escape from Nuckinfutts Factory". I created this as a solo project, so I modelled, textured, rigged, animated, scripted, did the VFX and lighting for everything in this project. It was quite the undertaking and parts of it remained unfinished, but I'm still proud of what I was able to achieve alone while learning Unity for the first time.</p>
